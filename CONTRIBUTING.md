# Contributing Guidelines

We hope you are enjoying Elegant products and look forward to receiving your feedback. Whether you want to report a bug, request a feature, or request a correction to something, we value input from our community.

To ensure we fully understand your request, we ask that you read this document and submit any issues or pull requests accordingly. This will help us make the right decisions and take the appropriate actions.

## Feature Requests

You are welcome to create new issues on this project to request new features for any of Elegant's products.

If you would like to suggest a new feature, we ask that you use our issue template. This includes several essential questions that will help us understand the problem you are trying to solve and how your suggestion is intended to address it. We also tag incoming issues from this template with "community idea". This allows our teams to quickly see what has been proposed and better address community recommendations.

You can see what has already been proposed by the community [here](https://github.com/elegantapp/roadmap/labels/comunity%20idea).

### Watch out for duplicates! 

Before creating a new issue, please check [existing open issues](https://github.com/elegantapp/roadmap/issues) or [recently closed issues](https://github.com/elegantapp/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). It is easier for us to prioritize a single, highly-voted issue.

## Reporting Bugs

We ask that you do not use this repo to report bugs. Each of our products has its own repository where issues related to that product should be submitted. We have chosen to do this because our products are quite different and require different information in order for us to understand how to help you.

To report a bug, please use issues of individual repos:
* [pwa-asset-generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator/issues)

## Security Issue Notifications
Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.
If you discover a potential security issue in this project, we ask that you notify Elegant security and send your report privately to [security@elegant.app](mailto:security@elegant.app). Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.

## Licensing
