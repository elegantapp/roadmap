# Elegant Roadmap

Thank you for the interest in Elegant and our products!

This is the public roadmap for Elegant products and services (cli, app, docs, actions).

## Introduction
We want to share our plans with our customers early and frequently so that we can get their feedback on whether these are the right areas of focus for us. This also enables our customers to make early decisions based on what we are or are not building.

[See the roadmap »](https://github.com/orgs/elegantapp/projects/3/views/1)

## Early access to features

Users of Elegant who are interested in early access to new features can join our [Developer Preview Program](mailto:early@elegant.app?subject=Elegant%20Developer%20Preview%20Program&body=Hi%20there%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20join%20the%20Elegant%20Developer%20Preview%20Program.%20Please%20let%20me%20know%20of%20early%20access%20to%20new%20features!).

## Participate in user research
During these live feedback sessions, we will often show features or ideas that are still in progress and ask for your input, or ask you more about how you use Elegant to identify any pain points when working with the product. We use these insights to help prioritize our roadmap and improve the user experience. Each session usually lasts for 30 minutes to an hour. 

If you would like to participate in one of our user research studies, please [sign up](mailto:research@elegant.app?subject=Participate%20in%20user%20research&body=Hi%20there%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20participate%20in%20Elegant%20user%20research%20studies.%20Feel%20free%20to%20contact%20me%20when%20you'd%20like%20to%20run%20a%20user%20research.) and we will contact you when we have something to research or test.

## Security
Please do not create a public GitHub issue. If you have discovered a potential security issue in this project, we ask that you notify Elegant Security and send your report privately to security@elegant.app. Do not create a public GitHub issue.

## FAQ

### Is everything on the roadmap?

We may keep some features a surprise if we are not sure about them, but most feature-related information will be shared. We will also not be tracking all of our bugs here; we have separate repositories for them:

* [pwa-asset-generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator/issues)

### Why are there no dates on your roadmap?

We understand that circumstances can change, and we want the flexibility to address security issues and bugs as they arise or provide assistance where needed. This may require us to adjust our priorities, and we do not want to disappoint anyone.

### How can I provide feedback or request more information?

Please open an issue in this repository! If the issue is a bug or security issue, please follow the separate instructions provided above.

### How can I request that a feature be added to the roadmap?

Please open an issue! You can learn about how to contribute [here](https://github.com/elegantapp/roadmap/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Issues submitted by the community will be tagged "community idea" and will be reviewed by the team.

### Will you accept a pull request?

We have not yet determined how pull requests should work for a public roadmap page, but we will carefully review all PRs for inclusion. Please read about contributing. We review these submissions on a weekly basis.
